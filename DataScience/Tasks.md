## DataScience Internship tasks
###  What you need to do
* Create a private repo called “dansonsolutions-DS-internship” in Github
* Solve the problem mentioned below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages)
* Invite internship@dansonsolutions.com to that particular private repo
* Submit your application [here](https://share.hsforms.com/1JmZDKTLrTzKHPc-vmvuhVQbsesu).

#### Go To - https://moodleschema.zoola.io/ (Understand the schema of important table)
#### Go To - [Resources](https://github.com/DansonSolutions/Career/tree/main/DataScience/Resources) and download all the files.

### Problem
1. Write .SQL query to create schema “Test”
2. Write .SQL query to add all tables from chimpvin_cvmdlOrg-2.sql file to Test schema
3. Write .SQL query to count number of tables in this schema
4. Write .SQL query to count unique ‘firstname’ from mdl_user tables
5. Write .SQL query to determine number of quizzes we have by using mdl_quiz table
6. Write .SQL query to find the highest grade from mdl_quiz_grades table
7. Write .SQL query to find userid having grade highest score (use mdl_quiz_grades and mdl_user table)
8. Write .SQL query to find users ‘firstname’ having highest score (use mdl_quiz_grades and mdl_user table)

### Bonus points
1. Write .sql query to find average of grades for each userid in mdl_quiz_grades table (Use mdl_quiz_grades and mdl_user table). Output must have 3 column Average grade, Firstname, userid). Save this query output into .csv file.
2. Use the above .csv file and load it into Tableau software 
3. Create a dashboard using Tableau with simple firstname VS avg_grade bar plot and set it descending order (Use .csv file from Q1)
4. Further analyze the dataset and show some visual representation of your findings.

#### Create a report with screenshot of SQL script and output with small explanation.
#### Upload report as well as .SQL file on github.

#### Note - You can use any software or terminal to run all queries (MySQL workbench preferred)
